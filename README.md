## Description of Tasks

### 1. Indexing and Search Optimization

- Indexes were created on `name`, `email`, and `enrollment_date` to improve query performance.
- Performance was measured before and after indexing, showing significant improvement.

### 2. Schema Validation

- Schema validation was implemented to enforce correct data formats and ranges.
- Validation successfully rejected invalid documents during testing.

### 3. MongoDB Data API Simulation

- Simulated basic CRUD operations using MongoDB Playground scripts.

### 4. MongoDB Charts

- Created visualizations including pie, bar, and line charts to gain insights from student data.

## Conclusion
